## Workflow
The repository follows the Git/GitHub workflow previously established for this course:
1. **Clone** the repository to your local machine using `git clone`.
2. Create a **new branch** for each assignment or feature using `git checkout -b branch-name`.
3. Make changes and **commit** them with meaningful commit messages using `git add` and `git commit`.
4. **Push** the branch to GitHub with `git push origin branch-name`.
5. Open a **Pull Request** on GitHub for review and feedback before merging into the main branch.
